# Abandoned 90's Desktop Horror Game Concept

> **Author's Note:**
>
> Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I would like to clarify that my primary intention in showcasing my old projects is to preserve an archival record of my work that I am proud of, as well as to highlight some of my **past** skills and experiences.
>
>I want to emphasize that these projects have not been actively maintained (last worked on in 2019), and as a result, the quality of their assets may not meet current standards. Therefore, I recommend thoroughly verifying their quality before considering their use.

Project Time Cycle: September, 2019 - November, 2019
Latest Version Of Unity Used: 2021.3.22f1

## Description

This repository is an **archival** upload of a 2D desktop horror game. It was originally developed as a personal project  and is provided here solely for **archival and portfolio purposes**, showcasing past work. Inspired by retro desktop environments, the game planned to offer a scary experience as you navigate a 90's desktop containing dark secrets. This project is no longer actively maintained.

## Usage

Because I am unsure of the legality of sharing Windows 95 along with other assets they have been stripped away, so this project will only contain assets that I have made or have worked on or have the rights to distribute. The third party assets that I do have rights to distribute will be credited below.
